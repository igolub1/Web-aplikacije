			<h2>Humpback whale spotted in New York Harbor near Statue of Liberty</h2>
			<p class="description">The massive marine mammal frolicked in front of Lady Liberty, One World Trade Center and other iconic NYC sights.</p>
			<p>A humpback whale was ready for its close-up frolicked in front of the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade Center and other iconic sights off New York Harbor on Tuesday.</p>
			<p>The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed reports of the sighting, but said it would get involved only if the whale became entangled or otherwise became endangered.</p>
			<p>“The whale just blew about 1,000 feet off my bow!” Bjoern Kils, 41, gasped as he snapped photographs of the creature he estimated to be about 40 feet long.</p>
			<p>“We’re aware, but it’s pretty normal that we get whales out there,” Petty Officer Anthony Pappaly told Reuters.</p>
			<p>In recent years, more than a dozen humpback whales have been detected in New York waters, according to state data, with some as close to shore as 550 yards from the beach in Rockaway, Queens.</p>
