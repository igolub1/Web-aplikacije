			<h2>'World's loneliest elephant' Kavaan arrives in Cambodia with help from Cher.</h2>
			<p class="description">The plight of the male Asian elephant has captured worldwide attention, including from Cher, who was closely involved in his rescue.</p>
			<p>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Kaavan, dubbed the “world’s loneliest elephant” after languishing alone for years in a Pakistani zoo, was greeted on his arrival in Cambodia on Monday by chanting Buddhist monks and was then sent on his way to a wildlife sanctuary.</p>
			<p>Like other travelers during these times, the elephant needed to be tested for Covid-19 before his flight. Once his large metal crate was safely on board, Kaavan was provided with in-flight snacks — 440 pounds of them — for the seven-hour journey.</p>
			<p>Kaavan was not stressed during the flight, eating his food and even getting a little bit of sleep standing in his crate, said Amir Khalil, a veterinarian who accompanied him on the flight and works with Four Paws, the Vienna-headquartered animal rescue group that organized the move.</p>
			<p>“He behaves like a frequent flier. The flight was uneventful, which is all you can ask for when you transfer an elephant,” Khalil said.</p>
			<p>The 36-year-old, 9,000-pound elephant received a warm welcome on arrival in Cambodia from officials, conservationists and the Buddhist monks, who chanted prayers for his harmony and prosperity.</p>
            <p>Kaavan, a 1985 gift from Sri Lanka to Pakistan, had been living in the Marghazar Zoo in Islamabad with his partner Saheli, who died in 2012. The zoo fell on hard times and conditions got so bad that a court in the Pakistani capital ordered the zoo closed in August.</p>
            <p>The plight of the male Asian elephant has captured worldwide attention, including from the American singer and actor Cher, who has been closely involved in his rescue and was in Cambodia for Kaavan’s arrival.</p>
